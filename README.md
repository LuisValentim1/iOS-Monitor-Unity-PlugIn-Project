# iOS Monitor Unity PlugIn Project
 Unity compatible Swift plugin to monitor CPU, GPU and RAM usage on iOS devices.
 Currently the unity project is using simulated data, the repository contains a plan for how to develop the intended plugin in xCode. This plan will be put in practice as soon as I have access to a macOS system.
