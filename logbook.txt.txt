	Reviewed solution, realized I can't use xCode on Windows which might be a big problem 
	Created this repository 

      18:00-18:30 
	Planned how to get around the xCode problem, I do believe I can develop it using Flutter and then integrate into Unity, functionally I believe its the same. I don't know if this breaks the iOS native requirement but I don't have an iOS machine or access to one easily so for now I will try this.
	Downloaded Unity's latest LTS version
	Updated documentation
